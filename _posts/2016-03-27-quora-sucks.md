If you're not aware, Quora is a Q&A site targeted at Bay Area startup types, centered mostly around STEM questions. There are some legitimately interesting and good questions and answers. My favorite are about the space program, where there are answers by scientists, astronauts astronomers, and other thoughtful experts. Regrettably a huge portion of the site is dedicated to self-congratulatory programmers and entrepreneurs, asking and answering questions mainly to brandish their credentials and success stories. It's a loudspeaker for achievement culture and a philistine kind of STEM boosterism.
